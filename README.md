Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarizes subscriber counts, engagement metrics, and category trends.
Visualizations: Features bar plots, word clouds, and an interactive dashboard built with Plotly to explore top influencers by engagement and audience country.
Feature Engineering: Adds columns like Subscriber Tier, High Engagement, and Primary Category for deeper insights.

DATASET

Columns: Instagram name, Name, Subscribers, Audience country, Authentic engagement, Engagement average, Category_1, Category_2.
Size: ~1,050 entries (cleaned to ~983 after removing duplicates).
